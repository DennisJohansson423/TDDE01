## What I Learned in This Course
- Core machine learning methods: regression, classification, neural networks, kernel models
- Model selection and evaluation: splits, cross-validation, MSE, misclassification
- Dimensionality reduction and feature handling: scaling, PCA, interpreting components
- Overfitting vs. underfitting and how regularization / complexity control affects generalization
